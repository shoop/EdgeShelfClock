# Edge Shelf Clock
This is my version of [the Edge Shelf Clock](https://www.diymachines.co.uk/how-to-build-a-giant-hidden-shelf-edge-clock). Notably it uses 4 full digits to accomodate 24 hour clock.

Documentation in the docs folder:
- construction.drawio - drawing of the parameters when constructing
- schematic.fzz - Fritzing file for the breadboard setup

Also some datasheets for the used components.

BOM:
- 1 x ESP8266
- 1 x DS3231 RTC module
- 1 x PhotoResistor module for Arduino
- 1 x 5V 10A power supply
- printed components (see 3dprinter folder and [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4207524))
- wire, backboard and screws
