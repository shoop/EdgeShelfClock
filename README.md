# Edge Shelf Clock
This is my version of [the Edge Shelf Clock](https://www.diymachines.co.uk/how-to-build-a-giant-hidden-shelf-edge-clock). Notably it uses 4 full digits to accomodate 24 hour clock.

Documentation in the `docs` folder:
- construction.drawio - drawing of the parameters when constructing
- schematic.fzz - Fritzing file for the breadboard setup

Also some datasheets for the used components.

BOM:
- 1 x ESP8266
- 1 x DS3231 RTC module
- 1 x PhotoResistor module for Arduino
- 1 x barrel jack connector
- 2 x 470 ohm resistor
- 1 x 1000uF capacitor
- 1 x 5V 10A power supply with barrel jack
- 1 x AdaFruit perma proto board
- red/green/black wire
- printed components (see `3dprinter` folder and [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4207524))
- wooden backboard
- screws

Tools in the `tools/` subfolder are not very configurable but work on my Linux machine. Adjust to taste.
